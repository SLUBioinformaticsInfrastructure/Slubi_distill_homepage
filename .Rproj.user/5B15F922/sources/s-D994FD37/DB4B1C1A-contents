```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)

```


You have several solutions:
    
1. Write an email to slubi@slu.se
  
2. Get in contact with us during an online drop-in session (see info below)
  
3. Join our Slack workspace and chat with us: [SLUBI-Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/slubi-workspace/shared_invite/zt-hamul6ub-VjMU0F2ZlonsqgXSVg7Cng)

We suggest that researchers contact SLUBI at an early stage to discuss the planned project, experimental design and what kind of support will be needed. Initial consultation is free. Subsequent SLUBI support and bioinformatics analyses cost 600 SEK/h.

SLUBI computing resources:

We have computing resources at all campuses and strive to coordinate the management of these.

<br>
Computing resources for the Swedish research community:

We would like to remind that researchers can get computing resources for free by applying to SNIC (Uppmax and other clusters).

Cloud computing

SLU has an agreement with Microsoft Azure for cloud computing (including price discounts). You can get more information by contacting the SLU IT-support.
