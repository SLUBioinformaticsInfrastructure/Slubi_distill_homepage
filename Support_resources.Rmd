SLUBI computing resources:

We have local computing resources at all campuses and strive to coordinate the management of these.

Computing resources for the Swedish research community:

We would like to remind that researchers can get computing resources for free by [applying to NAISS (Uppmax and other clusters)](https://www.uppmax.uu.se/support/getting-started/applying-for-a-user-account/).

Cloud computing

SLU has an agreement with Microsoft Azure for cloud computing (including price discounts). You can get more information by contacting the SLU IT-support.
