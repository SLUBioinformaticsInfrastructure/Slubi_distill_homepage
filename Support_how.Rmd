```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)

```


You have several solutions:
    
1. Write an email to slubi@slu.se
  
2. Get in contact with us during an online drop-in session (separate tab)
  
3. Join our Slack workspace and chat with us: [SLUBI-Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/slubi-workspace/shared_invite/zt-hamul6ub-VjMU0F2ZlonsqgXSVg7Cng)

We suggest that researchers contact SLUBI at an early stage to discuss the planned project, experimental design and what kind of support will be needed. Initial consultation is free. Subsequent SLUBI support and bioinformatics analyses cost 800 SEK/h.
