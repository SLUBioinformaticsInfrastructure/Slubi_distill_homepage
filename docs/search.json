This support is\nhighly individual and depends on your needs.\nWe can run all bioinformatic analyses for you. Alternatively, if you\nwant to run the analyses yourself but need help to get started, we can\ngive expert advice or training. We can be there as a discussion partner\nfor your whole project if you like.\nWe have no application deadlines, and projects are accepted\ncontinuously.\nIf you are interested, please contact\nus. We will then set up a first meeting with one of our experts.\nOnce you have agreed with the expert to what analyses should be\nperformed, a contract will be written. Once the contract is agreed upon,\nsigned by the project’s PI, and submitted to SLUBI, the support can\nstart.\nDuring the support you will communicate with the expert via email\nand/or meetings as necessary. Our coordinator will also be available to\nsupport you if needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
